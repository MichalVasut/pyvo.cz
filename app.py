"""
Configuration for deploying pyvo.cz on the rosti.cz hosting.

It should be easy to adapt to other kinds of WSGI-based hosting.


Instructions:
- Put this repo in /srv/app. You'll need to clear the previous contents:

        rm -rf /srv/app
        git clone https://github.com/pyvec/pyvo.cz /srv/app

- Clone the data directory here:

        git clone https://github.com/pyvec/pyvo-data /srv/app/pyvo-data

- Make a password file for the Github hook:

        echo YOUR_RANDOM_PASSWORD > pull_password

  (This is not too secure; it's just to avoid DoS from anyone having access
  to the DB reload functionality)

- Install everything:

        pip install -r requirements.txt

- Deploy:

        supervisorctl restart app

- Configure the Github hook for pyvec/pyvo-data to
  POST to pyvo.cz/api/reload_hook?password=YOUR_RANDOM_PASSWORD

- If automated tweets of events are desired, set up pyvo-twitter according to
  https://github.com/pyvec/pyvo-twitter.
